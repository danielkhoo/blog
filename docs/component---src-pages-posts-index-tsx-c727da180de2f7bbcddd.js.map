To treat your lack of knowledge\n        as a blessing and embrace making mistakes. In a world of twitter and instagram, its far too easy to\n        see rockstars and prodigies effortlessly building and creating. Its easy to fall into the trap of thinking\n        that you can't do better. Well you can and should.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        About a year ago I started (and abandoned) a ghost blog where I posted tutorials and guides on the stuff I was\n        figuring out. It turned into a great resource for me to reference old work. But this time I'm going to do it a\n        little different. This blog is deliberately simple with super minimal styling. A raw place to dump raw, unpolished\n        widgets, helpers and wtv I happen to be working on. At least thats the plan.\n      </p>\n\n    </div>\n  </div>\n);\n\nexport default HelloWorld;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
