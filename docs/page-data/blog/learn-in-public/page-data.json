It really got me thinking about my learning process as a developer. I actively consume content on twitter and dev blogs but never really felt like I was qualified to create.</p>\n<p>What I love about the \"learn in public\" atttitude is precisely that. To treat your lack of knowledge as a blessing and embrace making mistakes. In a world of twitter and instagram, its far too easy to see rockstars and prodigies effortlessly building and creating. Its easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you can't do better. Well you can and should.</p>\n<p>About a year ago I started (and abandoned) a ghost blog where I posted tutorials and guides on the stuff I was figuring out. It turned into a great resource for me to reference old work. But this time I'm going to do it a little different. This blog is deliberately simple with super minimal styling. A raw place to dump raw, unpolished widgets, helpers and wtv I happen to be working on. At least thats the plan.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 29, 2019","path":"/blog/learn-in-public","title":"Learn in public"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
