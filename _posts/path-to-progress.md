This has evolved into a great excuse to learn a bunch of new stuff like Gatsby and JAMStack. I am also dabbling in LeetCode challenges which are always mindblowing, forcing you to consider weird edge cases.

So in no real order of priority, cause I'll change my mind anyway, here's the stuff I hope to learn/do in the next 6 months:

### Books

Been meaning to get both of these forever but I keep missing sales on them.

- Clean Code by Robery C. Martin
- Refactoring by Martin Fowler

### JAMStack

I feel like this is the way web dev is heading. Away from monolithic tightly coupled front/back ends.

- GraphQL
- Gatsby
- Serverless - AWS Lambda (I have credits to burn)

### Leetcode

Dislike how reliant I am on intellisense and excessive run cycles to produce code. Gonna force myself to code without all the modern convenience.

- Complete 50 problems

### React stuff

- Storybook - Build a personal library of reusable components with all accessibility/responsive behvaviours built in.
- Extract more common logic into custom reusable Hooks.
